# Database Testing

## Getting Started

The only requirement for running these tests is to have a working version of Docker installed.
Navigate to `org.example.databases` and run the following commands:
```bash
# to start all database containers
> docker-compose up 

# to stop all database containers
> docker-compose down
```

## Running Tests
Run this application like you would run any Java application.
Results can be found in `resources/org.example.results`
